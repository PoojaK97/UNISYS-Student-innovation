4. The matter was heard by the Commission. Shri Rakesh Singh, Advocate on behalf of the appellant stated that the information as sought for in aforementioned cases were related to departmental proceedings against the appellant. The information sought for by the appellant had been denied u/s 8(1) (h) of the RTI act. The departmental proceedings had been concluded and a penalty had been imposed upon him. Therefore the disclosure of information could not impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders. The appellant sought these documents in order to defend himself in the CBI court. The respondents stated that though the departmental proceedings had been completed, the matter relating to criminal proceedings is under investigation by the CBI. The prosecution in criminal matters is dealt by the State and not by the respondents. Hence the information sought by the appellant cannot be provided under the provisions of Section 8(1) (h) of the RTI act. Moreover the documents relating to criminal proceedings are in the custody of the CBI. However, in disciplinary proceedings the relevant documents based on which the appellant had been charge sheeted had already been provided to the appellant during the process of departmental proceedings.

5. The Commission accepts the submissions of the respondents that the documents as sought for by the appellant in criminal matter cannot be provided under the provisions of Section 8(1) (h) of the RTI Act in view of the ongoing proceedings. The respondents had provided relevant documents as sought for in the matter of departmental proceedings to the appellant. The Commission finds no reason to intervene in the decision of the respondents. The aforementioned appeals are disposed of.
